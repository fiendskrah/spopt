"/docs/notesbooks/" and "/notebooks" - redundancy?

### "/notebooks/azp.ipynb"
very light on narrative
summary or excerpt from Openshaw and Rao (1995)?
comments on code or summary after cell?
what does AZP stand for?

`Cluster 32 Mexican states into 8 regions using AZP algorithm (Openshaw, S. and
Rao, L. (1995)).` 

cell 8 narrative - the azp function and its parameters (what can you do?)
a side-by-side of before and after in the last cell

### "/notebooks/maxp.ipynb"

`Cluster 32 Mexican states into the maximum number of regions such that each
region as at least 5 states and homogeneity in per captia gross regional product
over 1950-2000 is maximized.`  - add 'h': "region has at least"

cell 7 - the maxP function and its parameters (what can you do?)

Cell 8 - # How many regions do we have?
