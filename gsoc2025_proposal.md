# [PYSAL] - Produce Routing Engine for `spopt`

Google Summer of Code 2025 Proposal

## Abstract

In the Python Spatial Analysis Library (`pysal`), the `spopt` package
is concerned with the formulation and solving of various spatial
optimization problems, particularly regionalization and location-based
problems. This project proposes to enhance the `spopt` package with a
`route` module, which will function as an API to set up and solve
vehicle routing problems (VRP), including parameterizing vehicles,
depots, and routes in various VRP setups. An example of the VRP can
found in this [Guinness delivery example][guinness].  In order to
accomplish this, the GSOC student will adapt code that has been
produced by the project mentor(s) which currently relies on an Open
Source Routing Machine (OSRM) instance running in the background. The
primary goal of this project is to generalize the routing framework
such that a user can provide precomputed duration and distances
matrices with objectives and constraints natively in `spopt`.

A secondary (_stretch_) goal of this project is to also produce code
and instructional tutorials for the VRPs in education research. For
this, we can adapt the VRP framework such that the depots include
origins (bus depots), supply depots (student bus stops), and final
destinations (schools). Additional optimization problems will be
considered, such as the student assignment-based [Segregation
Minimizing Problem][wei22].

## Technical Details

### `spopt's` Routing Engine

This project will enhance the `spopt` package in `pysal` with a
`route` module. This module will be designed to create and solve
problems from user provided data. 

The project mentor(s) have already done some work to produce the code
required to accomplish this for personal use, and seek to generalize
the code as a new module in `spopt`. Because of this, the GSOC student
is not starting from scratch. Some code shared to an [issue
thread][issue] contains an suggested example call:

```python
problem = Route(
    depot_location=(9.2413, 52.2921),
    depot_close=pandas.to_datetime("2025-01-02 20:00:00"),
    depot_name='My Depot',
).add_clients(
    data.geometry,
    data.demand_volume,
    data.time_windows,
    data.source.index,
    data.service_times
).add_trucks_from_frame(
   truck_df
).solve()
```

In this example API call, `problem` is an object which contains all of
the information and the solution to the VRP. The problem is primarily
being constructed through `Route` and depot variables are being
added/adjusted through `Route's` arguments. Functions are called as
extensions to `Route`to add client and truck data, and then a `solve`
function signals to `Route` that the parameterization is complete and
the model is ready to be solved.

Something that is not exposed in the API is how the travel network is
initialized for the problem. The depots and clients exist as static
points on the network, and the trucks traverse the network to deliver
product from the depots to the clients, but the network needs to be
included in the call so that the optimization solver can weigh the
total travel costs of different problem solutions.

### Existing code

Upon inspection of the [draft pull request][pull-request], the routing
engine code lives in `engine.py`. This file contains functionality to
generate the distance/duration matrices that represent the network
required to initialize a VRP in two key functions. `build_route_table()`
requires the target nodes in the network, which can be provided by the
arguments `demand_sites` and `candidate_depots`. `build_route_table()`
takes these nodes and locates them using the `get_coordinates()`
function. Similarly, the `build_specific_route()` function constructs a route
between each waypoint provided in a geopandas GeoDataFrame or
GeoSeries object by connecting to OSRM via the http interface or
through `py-osrm` if the http fails.

Looking at these two core functions, the routes are generated from a
travel network using the [Open Source Routing Machine][OSRM]
(OSRM). The existing code relies on an OSRM instance to produce the
distances and durations of routes along the network. This connection
is first attempted as an http call, but otherwise the functions
connect to OSRM through the `py-osrm` package ([link to
repository][py-osrm]). 

This constitutes the OSRM instance as a core dependence of this
module, along with the 'portal' used to initialize the instance, in
this case `py-osrm`. It is anticipated that the decision of how to
handle the generalized implementation of the travel network will
comprise the bulk of work on this project. Two potential solutions are
suggested below.

### Retaining C++ power via `nanobind`

OSRM functions on C++, which is generally more efficient for handling
heavy computational load relative to python. Because optimization can
quickly become computationally taxing, particularly if heuristic
solutions are undesirable, there is an argument in favor of simply
retaining the relationship to OSRM, because it means that the user can
'drop in to' C++ from python syntax.

The [nanobind][nanobind] package is designed to be an interface
between the two languages, meaning that python syntax can be leveraged
to call functions written in C++. The current code already does this
via its core functions `build_route_table()` and
`build_specific_route()` through `py-osrm`, but consistent
functionality is currently limited to specific operating systems.

Because this would leverage code that has already been written, it is
an attractive solution. However, the project proposes to add `pyvrp`
and OSRM via `nanobind` and `py-osrm` as dependencies; the impacts
of this dependence to the future maintenance burden of `spopt` is
uncertain. The potential for updates to the ecosystems of the other
packages suggest that maintaining this functionality could be impacted
going forward.

### Replacing the `OSRM` engine

An alternative solution would be to replace the OSRM element with
something native to python. This solution would reduce, but not
eliminate, the dependence on other projects. Because the remaining
dependence would be with python packages, replacing the current engine
avoids the need to bridge the gap between python and C++, and is less
burdensome from a future-proofing perspective.  One option suggested
in the [issue thread][issue] was to implement the routing engine via
`routingpy` ([link][routingpy]), a python client for interfacing with
popular web services to retrieve distance/duration matrices.

This option requires addressing a major issue: Which of the online
providers will be used for obtaining the travel network? This invites
a subquestion: should `spopt.route` maintain support for multiple
routing services? `routingpy` supports OpenStreetMap, Google Maps,
Mapbox, and more, so building the engine around `routingpy` could mean
that the `spopt.route` user could choose which of these mapping
services to ping for the travel network. The relative accuracy of the
networks provided between these services is unknown.

Additionally, routingpy has recently been archived, making future
functionality uncertain. From the README of the main branch of the
[routingpy github repository][routingpy]:

> "In case anyone has interest to take over this repository, please
> write me on my public email. To be eligible you should have a proven
> track record of FOSS python projects and ideally some PyPI package
> management experience."

Of the extant services, [OpenStreetMap][osm] (OSM) is perhaps the
most ubiquitous in the open source world because of its ready
availability. If it is decided that reliance on only one network
source is acceptable, OSM is likely the path of least resistance, due
to the abundance of code that has already been written around
it. Other packages such as [pandana][pandana] offer effective OSM
loaders that could be considered as routing engine drivers.

### VRP and Optimization

Under discussed thus far are the quantitative methods underlying the
proposed `spopt.route` module, which sit atop the `pyvrp` package. A
quote from `pyvrp's` [introduction to vrp][vrp]:

> "various heuristics, metaheuristics, and exact methods have been
> developed to tackle the VRPs, including but not limited to, local
> search, genetic algorithms, and branch-and-cut algorithms."

The two general categories of algorithms are those that seek
*heuristic* solutions, meaning estimated to be good, and those that
seek *optimal* solutions, meaning precisely the best, relative to some
quantified stated criteria. The decision of which algorithm to use
depends on the specific application. In terms of the existing
algorithms that can find optimality, the GSOC student is most
knowledgeable about [branch and bound][bnb]. Learning about
optimization through this project is an opportunity where guidance
from the project mentors will be pedagogically impactful to the GSOC student.

### Stretch Goal: Support for Other Route-Based Problems

The primary deliverable of this project is the implementation of the
variants of the VRP, including Capacitated VRP, Split Delivery VRP,
and Prize Collecting VRP. The application of the VRP represents
pedagogical value for the GSOC student, but the generalized
implementation of the routing engine would enable the application of
other route based models, i.e. optimization applications that require
distances and durations from mapping services. Therefore a stretch
goal for the GSOC student would be to additionally write code to
leverage a generalized routing engine for other problems, such as the
project described in the *School District Optimization for Exploratory
Spatial Data Analysis* section below. The decision to pursue this will
be discussed and finalized during the *Community Bonding and Scoping Period*.

## Schedule of Deliverables

### **Community Bonding and Scoping Period**

The primary purpose of this period is to reach decisions about the
issues raised in the *Technical Details* section and fill any gaps in
the GSOC student's knowledge . The GSOC student will meet with the
advisor(s) to itemize the project into tractable tasks which will
populate the two phases of the project with various
deadlines. Progress on the project will be tracked with regular
postson my [blog][blog].

#### Deliverable targets

- Finalized decision about replacing the routing engine or further integrating with OSRM
- Finalized GSOC schedule of tasks and deliverable deadlines

### **Phase 1**

The primary deliverable of phase 1 is a working version of the
generalized routing engine, which will be capable of initializing,
parameterizing, and solving a VRP.

#### Deliverable target

- Generalized routing engine
- Tutorial jupyter notebook demonstrating implementation of VRP

### **Phase 2**

The phase 2 deliverable will iterate on the routing engine by
implementing additional models and edge case functionality and
reaching for the stretch goals outlined above. At the outset of phase
2, the GSOC student will meet with the mentor(s) to determine the
extent of the stretch goals that will be pursued.

### Deliverable target

## Development Experience

I have two projects on Github that are relevant to this proposal. They
demonstrate my competency in collaborative coding projects (i.e. the
git cycle) as well as in the relevant coding language (i.e. python
modules with large data handling requirements) and application
contexts (i.e. spatial optimization). Both of these projects are tied
to dissertation research, which I aim to publish in academic
journals. Because of this, I do not wish to make the repositories
public until the associated work is published.

While I do not wish to make these repositories public at this time, I
am happy to invite the project mentor(s) as well as any relevant
NUMFOCUS or GSOC associates who are a part of the application decision
process via their github accounts to inspect the repositories. Find a
brief description of these projects below.

### School District Optimization for Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis

[Link to project repository][dist-opt]

This project aims to apply a specific spatial optimization problem as
an exploratory technique, rather than as a prescriptive solution,
which is the usual application in education settings. Classic
implementations of the Generic Districting Problem ([6][sch91]) have
been recently adapted for the purposes of addressing segregation in
school districts ([1][wei22]). This adaptation has revealed
relationships between key constraints in the optimization framework,
particularly an inverse relationship between student segregation in
the district and the travel time for students to get from their
neighborhoods to their schools. Because this relationship has only
been demonstrated in a single school district in Riverside,
California, this project aims to investigate this dynamic across every
school district in California. Through the parameterization of
optimization models, new variables are created. Another angle of this
research is to leverage these new variables in econometric analysis
with other socioeconomic variables that are of interest to education
segregation scholars.

### Comparative Neighborhood Fragmentation

[Link to project repository][contig-frag]

This project is a comparative analysis between two methodologies for
neighborhood delineation based on census areal units. The first method
involves the commonly applied K-means algorithm to regionalize units
based on common attributes into typologies. We borrow an expanded
version of this method from recent ([2][del19], [3][del15]) works and
compare it to a spatially-explicit neighborhood regionalization method
([4][rey11]) in the context of neighborhood fragmentation. We use
census data to compare these two methods in 50 metropolitan areas in
the United States over a 30 year period.

## Why this project?

This project provides tangible benefits to my growth as a
scholar. 

Firstly, it elevates my proficiency with python. Through my work in
graduate school, I have evolved from someone who had a casual interest
in computers to an intermediate data scientist. My work has gradually
required more elaborate python code, from simple data processing
scripts to multi-step analytics which leverages custom built python
modules. However, because I have had little formal training in
software development, being able to directly interface with the
project mentor(s) on a new feature in an established package will
teach me best practices of collaborative python development and code
structure

This project will also deepen my understanding of optimization
applications through developing code that aids in the parameterization
and solving of these models. Whereas my previous work has leveraged
Gurobi, a commercial solver made available to me on a student license,
this project will allow me to see the code ([5][rey09]) behind the
solver, allowing me to better understand the often opaque nature of
optimization under the guidance of advanced developers.
